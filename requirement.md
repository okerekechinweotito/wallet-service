# Wallet Service with Paystack, JWT & API Keys: Backend Stage 8 Task Submission Requirements

The goal is to test your ability to build simple backend endpoints, work with payments, authentication, service-to-service access, and basic wallet operations.

## Aim

Build a backend wallet service that allows users to deposit money using Paystack, manage wallet balances, view transaction history, and transfer funds to other users.

All wallet actions must be accessible using **JWT** authentication (from Google sign-in) or **API keys** (for service-to-service access).

## Objectives

- Understand how wallet systems work at a basic level.
- Implement Paystack deposits into a wallet.
- Allow users to view wallet balance and transaction history.
- Enable wallet-to-wallet transfers between users.
- Implement authentication using:
  - **JWT** (from Google sign-in)
  - **API keys** (for services)
- Enforce permissions, limits, and expiry on API keys.

## Scope

### In-Scope

- Google sign-in to generate JWT for users.
- Wallet creation per user.
- Wallet deposits using Paystack.
- Wallet balance, transaction history, and transaction status.
- Transfers between users’ wallets.
- API key system for service-to-service wallet access.
- Permission-based API key access.
- Maximum of 5 active API keys per user at a time.
- API key expiration and rollover.
- Mandatory Paystack webhook handling.

### Out of Scope

- Frontend / UI.
- Manual bank transfers.
- Other payment providers outside Paystack.
- Advanced fraud detection.

## High-Level Flow (Easy Description)

### Authentication

1.  Users sign in using Google.
2.  After successful login, they receive a **JWT**.
3.  Services can generate **API keys** for wallet access.

### Wallet Deposit (Paystack)

1.  User or service hits the deposit endpoint.
2.  Server calls Paystack to initialize a transaction.
3.  Paystack returns a `payment_link`.
4.  User completes payment on Paystack.
5.  Paystack sends a webhook to your server.
6.  Your server verifies the webhook and updates:
    - transaction status
    - wallet balance

:white_tick: Webhook implementation is **mandatory**. Paystack’s verify endpoint can still be used as a fallback for manual checks.

### Wallet Transfer

1.  User sends money from their wallet to another user’s wallet.
2.  System checks:
    - sender balance
    - valid recipient
3.  Wallet balances are updated.
4.  Transaction is recorded.

### API Keys (Service-to-Service)

- A user can generate API keys with specific permissions.
- API keys can access wallet endpoints instead of JWT.
- Only 5 active API keys are allowed per user.
- API keys:
  - must expire
  - can be revoked
  - can be rolled over into a new key using the same permissions.

## API Endpoints (Specification)

### 1. Google Authentication (JWT)

- `GET /auth/google`
  - Triggers Google sign-in.
- `GET /auth/google/callback`
  - Logs in the user.
  - Creates the user if not existing.
  - Returns a **JWT token**.

### 2. API Key Management

#### a. Create API Key

`POST /keys/create`

**Request:**

```json
{
  "name": "wallet-service",
  "permissions": ["deposit", "transfer", "read"],
  "expiry": "1D"
}
```

**Rules:**

- `expiry` accepts only: `1H`, `1D`, `1M`, `1Y` (Hour, Day, Month, Year).
- The backend must convert `expiry` into a real datetime and store it as `expires_at`.
- Maximum 5 active keys per user.
- Permissions must be explicitly assigned.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "api_key": "sk_live_xxxxx",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

#### b. Rollover Expired API Key

`POST /keys/rollover`

**Purpose:** Create a new API key using the same permissions as an expired key.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "expired_key_id": "FGH2485K6KK79GKG9GKGK",
  "expiry": "1M"
}
```

**Rules:**

- The expired key must truly be expired.
- The new key must reuse the same permissions.
- `expiry` must again be converted to a new `expires_at` value.

### 3. Wallet Deposit (Paystack)

`POST /wallet/deposit`

- **Auth:** JWT or API Key with `deposit` permission.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "amount": 5000
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "reference": "...",
  "authorization_url": "https://paystack.co/checkout/..."
}
```

### 4. Paystack Webhook (Mandatory)

`POST /wallet/paystack/webhook`

- **Purpose:** Receive transaction updates from Paystack. Credit wallet only after webhook confirms success.
- **Security:** Validate Paystack signature.
- **Actions:** Verify signature, find transaction by reference, and update transaction status and wallet balance.

**Response:**

```json
{ "status": true }
```

### 5. Verify Deposit Status (Optional Manual Check)

`GET /wallet/deposit/{reference}/status`

**Response:**

```json
{
  "reference": "...",
  "status": "success|failed|pending",
  "amount": 5000
}
```

:warning: This endpoint **must not** credit wallets. Only the webhook is allowed to credit wallets.

### 6. Get Wallet Balance

`GET /wallet/balance`

- **Auth:** JWT or API key with `read` permission.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "balance": 15000
}
```

### 7. Wallet Transfer

`POST /wallet/transfer`

- **Auth:** JWT or API key with `transfer` permission.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "wallet_number": "4566678954356",
  "amount": 3000
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Transfer completed"
}
```

### 8. Transaction History

`GET /wallet/transactions`

- **Auth:** JWT or API key with `read` permission.

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "type": "deposit",
    "amount": 5000,
    "status": "success"
  },
  {
    "type": "transfer",
    "amount": 3000,
    "status": "success"
  }
]
```

## Access Rules (JWT vs API Keys)

- If request has `Authorization: Bearer <token>` → treat as **user**.
- If request has `x-api-key: <key>` → treat as **service**.
- API keys must:
  - Have valid permissions.
  - Not be expired or revoked.
- JWT users can perform all wallet actions.

## Security Considerations (Simple)

- Do not expose secret keys.
- Validate Paystack webhooks.
- Do not allow transfers with insufficient balance.
- Do not allow API keys without correct permissions.
- Do not allow more than 5 active API keys per user.
- Expired API keys must be rejected automatically.

## Error Handling & Idempotency

- Paystack `reference` must be unique.
- Webhooks must be idempotent (no double-credit).
- Transfers must be atomic (no partial deductions).
- Return clear errors for:
  - insufficient balance
  - invalid API key
  - expired API key
  - missing permissions
